# Deep Learning Framework Study

Deep learning is a powerful tool for solving complex tasks, such as image recognition, text semantic understanding, and cross-discipline problems like medical diagnosis. These phenomena drive the study of deep learning frameworks to become essential foundations for future education and attract research interest from various domains.

## Objective

The developed deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras, have helped lessen learning thresholds. However, they may lead to shortcuts and a non-comprehensive understanding of deep learning frameworks. Therefore, **this study aims to implement an MLP from scratch using only scientific Python packages such as NumPy and SciPy to understand the intrinsic nature of MLPs. This approach helps to grasp how data is transformed from a large dataset into classified categories by a multi-layer architecture and how such structures can replace conventional, complicated heuristic-driven feature extraction**.

## Approach

This comprehensive, survey-like modularity study decomposes the complex deep neural network into smaller independent components and analyzes their interactions. For each module, we deeply study current conventional methods and make insightful comparisons. Specifically, we decompose the MLP model into the following modules:

- Activation Functions
- Optimizers
- Regularization
- Loss Functions
- Batch Normalization

## Contributions

With comprehensive experiments, we aim to better understand the intrinsic nature of deep learning models, their limitations, and possible improvements. **The contribution of this survey is to provide a detailed explanation with intuitive visualizations covering most parts of the deep learning framework, aimed at mitigating the difficulty for new researchers entering the deep learning field**.

## Paper Structure
Please see more detail and analysis in our paper is organized as follows:
- **Section 1: Methods** - Describes implementation details and reviews relevant literature for different modules.
- **Section 2: Experiments** - Analyzes and compares experiment results with visualization explanations and conducts an ablation study.
- **Section 3: Conclusion** - Concludes the study and provides insightful suggestions for future works.
